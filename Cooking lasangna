/*In this exercise you're going to write some code to help you cook a brilliant lasagna from your favorite cooking book.

You have four tasks, all related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.*/


package lasagna

const OvenTime = 40 // TODO: define the 'OvenTime' constant

// RemainingOvenTime returns the remaining minutes based on the `actual` minutes already in the oven.
func RemainingOvenTime(actualMinutesInOven int) int {
	return OvenTime - actualMinutesInOven
}

// PreparationTime calculates the time needed to prepare the lasagna based on the amount of layers.
func PreparationTime(numberOfLayers int) int {
	return numberOfLayers*2
}

// ElapsedTime calculates the time elapsed cooking the lasagna. This time includes the preparation time and the time the lasagna is baking in the oven.
func ElapsedTime(numberOfLayers, actualMinutesInOven int) int {
   
	return  (numberOfLayers*2) + actualMinutesInOven
}
